# PHP-Quiz-App
A simple math quiz that can be taken several times.

The purpose of this application is to test basic understanding of PHP syntax and session variables. This project was created for TreeHouse Talentpath.

## Features
* This app starts with an equation (e.g. “What is 48 + 12?”)
* Equations are dynamically generated without the use of a static question bank.
* Each question will have three answers to choose from.
* Answers are shuffled so that the correct answer is not always in the same position.
* A toast will be displayed stating whether the equation is answered correctly or incorrectly.
* After a toast is displayed the next question will be shown.
* Once all questions have been answered the final score will be displayed.
* The user may choose to start the quiz again.
